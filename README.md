# NOME CRIATIVO

## Idea
Facing the return from the pandemic and the consequential growth of entertainment activities, our group had the idea of generalizing in a website all, or perhaps most of, the amount of events, acts or activities that involves leisure in some form or another. Doing that is great because there isn't a unified app that provides the bridge between the user and the owner of the entertainment activity. The closest to some form of that is the tab "Entertainment" of Airbnb, but that is based on the long time, mostly for hiking, boat rides etc, and is not their main focus. Besides that, their intention is different than ours, because NOME CRIATIVO focuses on the short time entertainment, like a party on the weekend or a live presentation on a local bar at friday night.
