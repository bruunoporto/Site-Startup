## Idea
Facing the return from the pandemic and the consequential growth of entertainment activities, our group had the idea of generalizing in a website all, or perhaps most of, the amount of events, acts or activities that involves leisure in some form. Doing that is great because there isn't a unified app that provides the bridge between the user and the owner of the entertainment activity. The closest to some form of that is the tab "Entertainment" of Airbnb, but that is based on the long time, mostly for hiking, boat rides etc, and is not their main focus. Besides that, their intention is different than ours, because "Qual é a boa ?" focuses on the short time entertainment, like a party on the weekend or a live presentation on a local bar at friday night. The intention is to be more dynamic. So, Please check out our fresh [website](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

## Goals to next update
In order to be functional, our site has to be different to the proper Google Search. Everyone knows how to search for a good restaurant nearby ,for example, Google already does the filtering for us, by price and quality, measured by the 5 stars of avaliation in both questions. But quality is relative, it changes over time and highly varies by person interest, age and current mood. That is the exact potential of "Qual é a boa ?" . Thus, for next updates, we aim for a sorting by relevance, which, in the beginning, only takes into account the age, proximity and preference of the user. With that in perspective, we will add three initial main search interests: Exciting, Calming and Romantic or both. So, inside these tabs, the sorting will be done, obviously varying by user informations. 

## Goals to the distant future
Two things need to be part of the project in order for it to work. The first: monetization, which can be done by running adds. Like Google Search, adds can be shown above the sorting, so the site can be easily monetized. The second is the proper sorting. It is probable that ours will not be perfect initially, because user preference is very difficult to sort. But current technology allows us to approximate it to the reality, just as TikTok does, sorting could be done via deep learning algorithms, which takes into account all items above cited, and could involve Google's Interest List, to map the person's interest. As shown, "Qual é a boa ?" has plenty of room to grow.
